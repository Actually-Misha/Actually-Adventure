# Actually Adventure
Actually-Adventure is a light-hearted casual project undertook by myselfâ€” a novice. My intention was to produce a plausibly scalable means to create and run text adventures within a React-JS web environment. Though, I won't pretend I definitely worded that right. The game itself isn't intended to be a great story, since it's mainly an accessory to the idea itself.
## Requirements
- Node (JS)
- React (JS Framework)
- Web Browser (chrome browsers are recommended)
## Launching the game
- Run the `start.bat` file provided in the root folder
